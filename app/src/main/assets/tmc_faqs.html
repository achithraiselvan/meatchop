<h1>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQs</h1>
<p><strong>ABOUT QUALITY</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>How do we deliver fresh meat?</u></strong></p>
<p>The quality of the fresh meat rapidly deteriorates as the temperature rises above 4C. The quality of meat deteriorates if it is stored at a temperature between 5C to 60C and is not eligible for consumption. To avoid this, we store our meat at an optimum temperature of 4C. We also employ appropriate packing to maintain the freshness till it is delivered to your hands.</p>
<p><strong><u>Where do you procure meat from?</u></strong></p>
<p>We maintain a cordial relationship with the local farm and fishing communities keeping in mind the welfare of our customers. By partnering with them, we deliver the freshest meat to you having met the stringent operating protocols ensuring the tastiness, tenderness, and hygiene of the meat delivered.</p>
<p><strong><u>Do you freeze the meat/is your meat frozen?</u></strong></p>
<p>Never. Our meat is only chilled to maintain the freshness and is not subjected to freezing. We maintain a temperate between 0C-4C to ensure there is no change in the taste and texture of the meat. In this way, we deliver you the freshest meat with no compromise in the quality of the meat.</p>
<p><strong><u>Does your meat contain antibiotics?</u></strong></p>
<p>Definitely not! We follow stringent protocols to ensure that there are no antibiotics present in the meat that we deliver. The vendor selection process undergoes various quality checks before onboarding them onto our platform. Only then, we procure the meat from them which is free of antibiotics as we always maintain customer well-being as our priority.</p>
<p><strong><u>Does your seafood contain ammonia?</u></strong></p>
<p>Definitely not! We procure seafood from the local communities daily and employ proper technology to store them to maintain the freshness. The selection of those communities undergoes a lot of inspection as it is mainly concentrated on the grounds of procuring chemical-free and preservative-free foods. It does not involve any freezing too.</p>

<p>Yup. We are a Halal certified firm by Halal India Pvt Ltd. We adhere to all Halal Protocols and all our meat products can be deemed as 100% Halal.</p>
<p><strong><u>The price of seafood is more expensive than the local market. Why?</u></strong></p>
<p>We, The Meat Chop put genuine and sincere efforts to deliver you the freshest possible seafood. Hence, we must bear additional costs for procurement as well as for storing them. Also, the quality checks for choosing the vendors involve high cost which we never dare to compromise as customer well-being is our priority.
